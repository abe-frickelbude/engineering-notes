## Power supply issues

Be aware that in many cases the internal power supply within the `MySmartUSB Light` programmer is not stiff enough
and may cause the programmer to sporadically disconnect from USB if the "load" draws increased current while 
programming. Be sure to provide a stable external power supply to the MCU to avoid these errors.
